### Machine learning for unmanned vehicles.

The use of semantic segmentation and detection of objects on the map in the quadrocopter in real time, complementing the car.

The quadrocopter should make a 3D map of the area, segment photos, find objects on them and transmit this information to the car. After that, the car should make its route avoiding all obstacles.

**Good luck with coding**
